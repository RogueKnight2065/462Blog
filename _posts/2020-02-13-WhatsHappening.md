# A Brief Chronology of Medical Device Security

This article shows the development of emerging issues and solutions found in the rise of medical devices. Throughout recent history the development of medical devices is prevalent. Technologies rise to the need of the patient's needs. Over the years things like insulin pumps, pacemakers and databases have been developed to help patient and medical personal alike. Some if not all these devices have some form of security risk.

From 1980 to now the rise in complex systems in the medical field is prevalent and ever growing. In return network failures like the one that occurred in 2002 with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The system crashed because of the massive inflow of data to it. The system couldn't handle the flow so it crashed causing massive data loss throughout the medical center.

Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) came more along during the 2000s. These devices are implanted into the patient to monitor a body function or to keep the patient alive  like an insulin pump or pacemaker. In 2005, there was a workshop held to find and figuring out how to defend the possible threats to an Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators.

Similar threats occur everywhere in the medical community. Showing the timeline of where we came from as a society of possible threats can show us how to design things around these possible threats.
