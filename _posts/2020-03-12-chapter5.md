Chapter 5 has to deal with coding and testing. Outside of the Computer Science world coding and testing is what most people think Computer Scientists only do coding and testing. However coding and testing is very important and is key to what we do.

Coding is well writing code to fulfill a certain purpose. Coding can involve a web app or website, to games to firmware on a device. Coding is the action at which something that is computerized is made. After the code is made testing is necessary.

Testing is necessary when making something. If you want to make sure it works you need to test it. Testing the whole thing at ones is not enough and not efficient. The efficient way to test is to test each part individually then test it as you put it all together, similar to Legos. To make a good product testing is necessary however not over testing there is a limit to the testing.
