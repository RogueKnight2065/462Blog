My name is Matthew Anuszkiewicz, I am a senior at the College of Charleston, majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics.  I have been involved in research and multiple department clubs at the College.

In this blog you will find my notes and progress of my team's capstone project. You will also find my reflections on some articles we read and discuss in class.
