Through out the process of software development for open source projects it is known and wise to release content of the project early and often. There are a couple reasons for this. First, is so that the contributors knows what is going on and they know that the project is alive. Second is so that the project is consistently up-to date.  

Just updating code is not the thing that should be focused on however. Updating the documentation for the project and the comments is important as well. Answering any issues or bugs that contributors found is important. The format on how one should document their project is simple and not super technical unless technical speak is needed.  

Updating the documentation should be written similar to technical writing. Where the subject should be direct, concise, organized and precise. The more precise and direct on can be the more effective the writing. The more concise and organized the more of the point can get across in an effective manner. The documentation should not look like code comments, it should look professional.
