The last part of the Software Development process is releasing the project and maintaining it. Depending on the project that was made it can be released in many other ways. If the project is firmware made for a device the software is released with the device.

When releasing software that is not firmware, the way of update the software has to be considered. Understanding that the code must be up-to date and patched from bugs and massive errors. Releasing updates and patches should be easy and well documented, just in case more bugs were made.

When building open source software there are a lot of good places to post software and to have a community help maintain the code. Places like GitHub or SourceForge are wonderful places to post code and have a community help maintain the code.
