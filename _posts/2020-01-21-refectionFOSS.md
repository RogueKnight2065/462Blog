To gain a more broad view of open source projects we were assigned to read *The Cathedral and the Bazaar* by Eric Raymond. In this article Mr. Raymond writes about software development in regards to open source development.

Throughout this article he is comparing strategies of open source software development. There is one strategy that he compares to a Cathedral that is more closed off. A Cathedral is a massive church built by the Catholics. Their communities are built internally and there is typically no outside influence. Raymond compares a strategy of development to this because some companies use this way of thinking to make software.

Most companies development and use software that is designed not to be used outside of the company. There is no push to show others or share the software until the software is in use. In Raymond's article he points out the flaws of this and explains how most software should be development.

The Bazaar comparison is meant to show open source communities like a GitHub and FOSS (Free Open Source Software). He emphasizes that developing software that is open as possible is the most effective way to make software.

Personally I believe that most software that the public uses should be open to the public. Security systems and security infrastructures should remain behind closed doors yes. However widely used software like Linux was designed and developed using a more open strategy. This article reinforced my views on open source development.
