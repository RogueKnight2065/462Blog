*From STUPID to SOLID Code!* this article is about the major principles that coders should be following to make decent code. The first part of the article tells the reader about bad practice that cause massive bugs or testing issues.

The bad practices are abbreviated into STUPID: Singleton, Tight Coupling, Untestablilty, Premature Optimization, Indescriptive Naming, and Duplication. On the flip side of the coin there are practices that coders should follow which is abbreviated by SOLID. SOLID is Single Responsiblity Principle, Open/ Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle.

These SOLID principles follow a pattern but help the elimination of the issues that occur with the STUPID principles. Even though he states that SOLID is not rules or laws I personally think they should be treated as such. Understanding and following his SOLID principles will make anyone a better coder and those who make bullet proof code traditionally follow these principles.
