Meeting Charleston is a bit hard at these current time with COVID-19 not allowing us to meet in person. However over spring break my dad brought me along over some Zoom meeting for an investment group called VenterSouth. VenterSouth is a group of investors that are based in the Carolinas devoted to investing in businesses throughout the Carolinas.

The meeting that I attended with my dad was over Zoom. First there were presentation for companies asking for investors. There were three different companies that presented at the meeting I attended. The first was for a Banking Application that is being used in Africa called Yellow pages. The second was a 3D CAD converting company that took engineering drawings and converts them into CAD renderings. The last was a security firm that works with the government and designed a very fluid IT platform.

Listening to these presentation and seeing how they present themselves and their company was extremely valuable to me. They would portray the facts of what they do and had hard numbers to back up their statements. When asked a question they would respond with no hesitation unless it was a question that was super specific. The professionalism was amazing to see and understanding why investors ask certain questions started to make sense. I would recommend that if given the opportunity to just attend an investor meeting, take it because the skills that are shown are absolutely necessary to understand in the real world.
