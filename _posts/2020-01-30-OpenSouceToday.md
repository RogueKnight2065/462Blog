The articles I read were *How I had a nerdy date night with StreetComplete quests* and *How I teach physics using open source tools*. Both these articles are about different applications of using open source software.

In the article *How I had a nerdy date night with StreetComplete quests* the author introduces the use of an open source app know as StreetComplete. StreetComplete is an Android app that gives quests to a user to help fill information on OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap is an open data mapping project that anyone can use in their software or contribute data to, in return OpenStreetMap works on crowdsourcing. StreetComplete uses the crowdsourcing and makes it a game by requiring the user to go on quests to complete the map, similar to RPGs (Role Playing Games) like Skyrim or Fallout.

In *How I teach physics using open source tools* a physics professor from the University of Padova (Italy) shows and tells the reader about how and what tools he uses to teach physics. All if not most of his tools in the article are labeled and he describes their purpose. He uses multiple tools with some editing of the code to write his lectures and teach his students.

In both articles it is shown that open source software can be applicable to real life. In the first article it is shown how contributing data can be fun for a user and show a different side of crowdsourcing. Where as in the second article it is shown how the use of open source software can be used in a very wide spread manner, as long as you do your homework on the software. Both articles show how practical open source can be, as long as you know how to use it.
