This blog is made for Matthew's Software Engineering Practicum for the College of Charleston. This blog will catalogue the progress of his semester log project and discuss topics though out the class.

For questions he can be reached at the email below and any code talked about will be in his GitHub (also linked below).

This site was made with Jekyll. The documentation can be found at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
